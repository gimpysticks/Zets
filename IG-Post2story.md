When you share a multi-image post (a **Carousel**) to your Story, it doesn't automatically send every individual image as its own slide. Instead, Instagram creates a **single Story slide** that acts as a "teaser" for the entire post.

Here is exactly how it works and your options for sharing more:

### **1. The Default: One Teaser Slide**

When you tap "Add to Story" on a carousel post:

* **The Look:** Only the **first image** (the cover) appears in your Story.
* **The Interactivity:** Viewers will see a small "stacked squares" icon in the corner, signaling it's a multi-image post. When they tap the Story, a "See Post" button appears to take them to the full carousel.
* **Style Toggle:** You can tap the post in your Story editor to change the layout (e.g., a clean image-only look vs. a look that includes the account name and caption snippet).

### **2. Can You Share Individual Slides?**

You cannot "bulk share" every slide from a published post into your Story at once. However, you have two workarounds:

* **Manual Selection:** If you want a specific photo from the middle of your carousel to show up in your Story instead of the cover, you must navigate to that specific slide in your feed first, then tap the **Share (airplane)** icon. Instagram will then share that specific image to your Story.
* **Story Sequence:** You can repeat this process for each image in the post. Share slide #1, then go back and share slide #2, etc. This creates a sequence of Story slides, each linking back to the same post.

### **3. The "Mixed Media" Hack (Best for 2026)**

If you want to show off multiple images from the post on **one single Story slide**, do this:

1. Share the post to your Story as usual.
2. Tap the **Stickers** icon at the top.
3. Select the **Photo Sticker** (the one showing your most recent gallery photo).
4. Add the other images from your camera roll directly on top of the shared post.
* *Tip: This creates a collage effect where the "base" is the clickable post link.*
