﻿The technique you are referring to is called the "tank shell drop" or "top-down
attack". It is a high-risk, high-reward maneuver that can be used to devastating
effect against unsuspecting opponents.

To perform a tank shell drop, you will need to position your tank directly above
your target. This can be done by driving up a hill or ramp, or by using a crane
or other lifting device. Once you are in position, you will need to aim your
tank's main gun directly at the target.

The key to a successful tank shell drop is to time the release of the
shell correctly. If you release the shell too early, it will land in front of
the target. If you release the shell too late, it will land behind the target.

The ideal time to release the shell is just as it is passing over the target. If
you time the release correctly, the shell will fall directly onto the target,
causing massive damage.

This technique is particularly effective against lightly armored vehicles and
fortifications. However, it is important to note that the tank shell drop is a
very risky maneuver. If you miss your target, the shell could land anywhere,
potentially causing friendly fire casualties.

Additionally, if your tank is spotted while performing the maneuver, it will be
a sitting duck for enemy fire. As a result, the tank shell drop should only be
used as a last resort. However, when used correctly, it can be a very effective
way to eliminate a difficult target.
