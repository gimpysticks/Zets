# How to Mark All Servers as Read in Discord

To mark all servers as read in Discord, you have a few options:

## Method 1: Using Keyboard Shortcut
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + A` (or `Cmd + Shift + A` on Mac) - this will mark all channels in all servers as read

## Method 2: Manual Method
- Right-click on each server icon in the left sidebar
- Select "Mark As Read" from the context menu
- Repeat for each server

## Method 3: Using Discord Settings
- Go to User Settings (gear icon)
- Navigate to "Notifications" 
- You can adjust notification settings to reduce unread indicators, though this doesn't directly mark everything as read

**Note:** The keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl + Shift + A`) is the fastest way to mark everything as read across all your Discord servers at once.
