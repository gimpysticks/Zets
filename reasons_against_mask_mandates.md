bodily autonomy; freedom of the individual over corporations, the medical
establishment and the state; doubts about the safety, efficacy & necessity of
the vaccines; distrust of compromised, conflicted public health authorities that
failed to follow a trustworthy process in assessing vaccine safety, efficacy &
necessity; distorted incentives as drug makers, marketers & medical
professionals can only profit, not risk, in promoting vaccine; politically
partial & prejudicial professional class in medicine, academy, bureaucracy,
politicians & press that make them unreliable narrators in this context; history
of eugenics, Milgram experiment, Bill Gates agenda influencing the vaccine
mandate movement; and just a general distaste for treating Americans like Guinea
pigs.
