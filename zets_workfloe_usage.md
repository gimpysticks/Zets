The aliases use full paths ($HOME/bin/...) so they'll work regardless of PATH configuration, and I can see that ~/bin is already in your PATH from your existing .zshrc-personal file.

Ready to Use:
Your zets workflow is now properly organized and ready to use! The aliases are active and pointing to the correct script locations in ~/bin/. You can start using:

•  sz filename "title" to create new markdown files
•  az filename to append to existing files
•  lz to list your zets
•  vz to view the zets directory
