That's a great choice! Harry Houdini wrote several influential works, most notably in the areas of magic history and spiritualism exposé.

Here are three of his other most famous and important books:

### 1. 👻 *A Magician Among the Spirits* (1924)

This is arguably Houdini's most famous book after *The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin*, reflecting his later life crusade.

* **Synopsis:** The book details Houdini's passionate campaign to **expose fraudulent spiritualist mediums** and psychics who preyed on grieving families. It includes accounts of his attendance at numerous séances, his investigations into the tricks used by mediums (like table tipping, slate writing, and materialization), and the methods he used to replicate and debunk these supposed supernatural feats.
* **Context:** This was written during a time when Houdini was locked in a bitter public feud with his former friend, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was a staunch believer in spiritualism.

### 2. 🎪 *Miracle Mongers and Their Methods* (1920)

This work moves away from traditional stage magic to explore the history of sideshow and endurance performers.

* **Synopsis:** It is a historical deep dive into the lives and secrets of people who perform seemingly impossible or dangerous acts. Houdini covers fire-eaters, sword-swallowers, stone-eaters, poison-proofers, strong men, and human ostriches (who swallowed objects).
* **Theme:** Like his other books, the main theme is the exposure of secrets, showing that these acts are based on **skill, training, and physiological/mechanical trickery**, not supernatural power.

### 3. 🔑 *Handcuff Secrets* (1909)

This book is a direct exposé of his own craft, written early in his career to establish his authority and challenge competitors.

* **Synopsis:** The book reveals the basic principles behind escaping from various types of restraints, including handcuffs, leg irons, and jails. It discusses different lock picking tools, methods of concealment, and the critical importance of a sound knowledge of lock mechanics.
* **Impact:** It provided early details on the techniques that made him famous, even as he would publicly claim his escapes relied on physical prowess and willpower.
