If you’d like, I can now:

* Create **numbered combination recipes** (e.g., 9 + 12 + 27 = a specific horror mood)
* Generate prompts based on specific number combinations
* Create a darker “Level II” list (more brutal, less romanticized Victorian horror)
* Or expand this to 100 total elements for a larger reference library

What direction are you building toward?
