Here is the detailed recipe for the **Onion-Wrapped Flying Dutchman**, including instructions for making a simple copycat spread.

## 🧅 Animal Style Onion-Wrapped Flying Dutchman

This recipe combines the two beef patties and cheese with the key elements: grilled onions and a creamy sauce.

### Ingredients

| Component | Amount | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **For the Burgers** | | |
| Ground Beef (80/20) | 8 oz (two 4-oz portions) | Form into thin patties. |
| American Cheese | 2 slices | Essential for a perfect melt. |
| Salt and Pepper | To taste | Use generously. |
| **For the "Buns"** | | |
| Yellow Onion (Large) | 1 | Slice into two $1/2$-inch thick cross-sections. |
| **For the Copycat Spread** | | |
| Mayonnaise | $1/2$ cup | |
| Ketchup | 2 Tbsp | |
| Sweet Pickle Relish | 1 Tbsp | |
| White Vinegar | $1/2$ tsp | Optional, for tang. |

### 1. Make the Spread

1.  In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, ketchup, sweet pickle relish, and vinegar (if using).
2.  Mix well until smooth.
3.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate the spread while you cook the rest of the ingredients.

### 2. Prepare the Onion "Buns"

1.  Slice the yellow onion horizontally into two thick, circular pieces (the $1/2$-inch slices). Make sure they are sturdy enough to act as buns.
2.  Heat a skillet or griddle over **medium heat**. Add a little butter or oil.
3.  Place the onion slices on the pan. Cook slowly for about **8–10 minutes** per side, until they are deeply browned, softened, and sweet. *Do not rush this step*—the caramelization is key to the flavor. Set the finished onion slices aside.

### 3. Cook the Patties

1.  Turn the heat up to **medium-high**. Lightly oil the pan or griddle.
2.  Season the formed beef patties generously with salt and pepper.
3.  Place the patties on the hot surface. Smash them down lightly if you prefer thin patties.
4.  Cook for **2–3 minutes** until a dark, flavorful crust forms on the bottom.
5.  Flip the patties. Immediately place one slice of American cheese on top of each one.
6.  Cook for about **1 minute** until the cheese is perfectly melted.

### 4. Assemble the Flying Dutchman

1.  On the cooking surface, stack the two cheeseburger patties on top of each other.
2.  Take one of your caramelized onion slices and place it cut-side up on your plate—this is the bottom "bun."
3.  Place the cheeseburger stack directly on top of the bottom onion slice.
4.  Spread a generous layer of the prepared Copycat Spread on the cut-side of the remaining onion slice.
5.  Place the final onion slice on top, spread-side down.
