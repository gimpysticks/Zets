The Purple Heart is one of the most aesthetically complex and symbolic decorations in the United States military. Its design is split between the **obverse** (front) and the **reverse** (back), combining historical heraldry with modern sculpture.

### 1. The Obverse (Front)

The front of the medal is characterized by its distinct heart shape and rich coloring.

* **The Heart:** A heart-shaped medal,  inches wide. The center is made of purple-colored enamel (historically) or translucent purple plastic (modern), set within a gold-colored metal border.
* **The Washington Bust:** A gold-colored relief profile of **General George Washington** in his Continental Army uniform, facing to the viewer's left.
* **The Coat of Arms:** Positioned at the very top of the heart is the **Washington Family Coat of Arms**. This consists of a white enamel shield featuring two horizontal red bars and three red stars (often cited as the inspiration for the U.S. Flag).
* **The Sprays:** Flanking the coat of arms on both sides are sprays of **green enamel leaves**, symbolizing life and victory.

### 2. The Reverse (Back)

The back of the medal is simpler, made entirely of gold-colored metal (typically bronze with gold plating).

* **The Raised Heart:** The center is a raised metal heart without enamel.
* **The Inscription:** Inside the heart, the words **"FOR MILITARY MERIT"** are embossed in three lines of capital letters.
* **Personalization:** Below the inscription, there is a flat, blank space reserved for engraving the **recipient's name**.
* **Heraldic Repeat:** The Washington Coat of Arms and the leaf sprays from the front are repeated on the back, but they are rendered in plain gold-colored metal without the colored enamel.

### 3. The Ribbon and Suspension

* **The Colors:** The ribbon is  inches wide and is primarily **purple**.
* **The Borders:** It features a narrow **white stripe** ( inch) on each vertical edge.
* **The Attachment:** The medal hangs from the ribbon via a metal loop that is attached to the top of the coat of arms.
