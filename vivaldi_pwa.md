In Chrome browser, Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) use the browser's cache to store
data locally on the user's device. This means that the data is stored in the
same location as other cached data, such as images and other website content.

The specific location of the PWA data in the cache may vary depending on the
operating system and the version of Chrome being used. However, you can usually
find the PWA data by accessing the Chrome Developer Tools and navigating to the
"Application" tab.

From there, you can expand the "Cache Storage" or "IndexedDB" sections to view
and manage the data stored by the PWAs on your device.

To delete a Progressive Web App (PWA) in Vivaldi browser, you can follow these
steps:

Open Vivaldi browser and navigate to the PWA that you want to delete.

Right-click on the PWA icon in the address bar.

Select "Remove from Chrome" from the context menu.

Note that the option says "Remove from Chrome" instead of "Remove from Vivaldi"
because Vivaldi is built on the same Chromium engine as Google Chrome.

A pop-up message will appear asking you to confirm the deletion. Click on
"Remove" to proceed.

The PWA will be removed from your Vivaldi browser, and its data and settings
will be deleted.

Alternatively, you can also remove PWAs from Vivaldi by accessing the browser's
settings:

Open Vivaldi and click on the Vivaldi menu button (the V icon) in the top-left
corner.

Select "Settings" from the menu.

In the settings page, click on the "Webpages" tab.

Click on "Manage Webpages" to view a list of all installed PWAs.

Find the PWA you want to remove, and click on the trash can icon next to it.

Confirm the deletion in the pop-up message.

Once you delete the PWA, its data and settings will be removed from your Vivaldi
browser.
