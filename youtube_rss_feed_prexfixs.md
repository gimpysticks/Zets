In today's video I show you how to get RSS urls from YouTube channels and playlists.

The channel ID prefix URL for RSS:
https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=

The username prefix URL for RSS:
https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?user=

The playlist prefix URL for RSS:
https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=

I've also included the examples from my channel below. If the following URLs no longer work, then YouTube have changed how they do RSS URLs, if these links work, but yours don't, you're probably doing something wrong.

The channel ID RSS:
https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAPR27YUyxmgwm3Wc2WSHLw

The username RSS:
https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?user=ChrisWereDigital

The playlist RSS:
https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PLyga2RDU50AODdcN9aIkg4rXwxS-174uW
