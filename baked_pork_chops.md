The cooking time and temperature for baked bone-in pork chops will vary depending on the thickness of the chops. Here is a general guide:

1-inch thick pork chops: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
1.5-inch thick pork chops: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
2-inch thick pork chops: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
It is important to use an instant-read thermometer to check the internal temperature of the pork chops. Pork chops are considered safe to eat when the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Here are some additional tips for baking bone-in pork chops:

Pat the pork chops dry before seasoning them. This will help the seasonings adhere to the meat.
Season the pork chops with salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings.
Place the pork chops in a single layer in a baking dish.
Bake the pork chops until they reach the desired internal temperature.
Let the pork chops rest for 5 minutes before serving. This will allow the juices to redistribute throughout the meat.
