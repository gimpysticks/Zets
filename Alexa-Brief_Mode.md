To stop Alexa+ from engaging in extra idle chit-chat, unnecessary follow-ups, or overly verbose responses after answering your query (a common complaint with the more conversational AI-powered Alexa+ updates), try these main fixes. The most effective one for reducing extra talking is **Brief Mode**.

### Enable Brief Mode (Primary Solution)
This makes Alexa shorter and less chatty overall—replacing wordy confirmations with beeps or minimal speech, and cutting down on unnecessary elaboration.

1. Open the **Alexa app** on your phone.
2. Tap **More** (bottom menu).
3. Select **Settings**.
4. Scroll to **Alexa Preferences** (or directly to **Voice Responses** in some versions).
5. Tap **Voice Responses**.
6. Turn **ON** **Brief Mode**.

- Alexa will now be much more concise and should stop most idle follow-up chatter after responses.
- You can also say out loud: "Alexa, turn on Brief Mode" to enable it quickly.

### Other Helpful Adjustments
- **Disable Follow-Up Mode** (if the blue light stays on and she keeps listening/adding chit-chat):
  - In the Alexa app: Go to **Devices** > select your Echo device > **Device Settings** > turn off **Follow-Up Mode**.
  - Or say: "Alexa, turn off Follow-Up Mode."
  - This prevents her from staying in "conversation mode" after your command.

- **Stop promotional suggestions or "By the way" comments** (including Alexa+ upsell stuff):
  - In the Alexa app: **More** > **Settings** > **Notifications** > **Things to Try** (or **Alexa Device Notifications**) — toggle them **off**.

- If it's still too talkative even with Brief Mode:
  - Tell Alexa directly: "Alexa, keep responses short" or "Alexa, be brief" — she sometimes adjusts temporarily based on feedback.
  - Check for device-specific settings: In the app, go to the individual Echo device settings and look for any voice or response length options.

These steps address the extra conversational behavior introduced in newer Alexa versions (including Alexa+). If it's a very recent change or persists, check the Alexa app for any new "Alexa+ Preferences" section or say "Alexa, how do I make you less chatty?" for on-device guidance. Let me know if a specific type of chit-chat (e.g., suggestions vs. follow-ups) is the main issue!
