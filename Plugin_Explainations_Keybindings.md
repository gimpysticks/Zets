> explain the chatgpt commands and use

âœ¦ The jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim plugin integrates OpenAI's ChatGPT directly into your Neovim environment, allowing you to leverage AI for various coding and text-based tasks.

  Based on your configuration in chatgpt.lua, here's an explanation of its likely commands and usage:

  Core Functionality:

   * AI-Powered Assistance: The plugin enables you to interact with the ChatGPT API (specifically configured to use gpt-4o-mini) for tasks such as:
       * Code Generation: Asking ChatGPT to write code snippets or functions.
       * Code Explanation: Getting explanations for selected code blocks.
       * Code Refactoring/Editing: Providing instructions to modify or improve existing code.
       * General Chat: Engaging in conversational interactions with the AI.

  Key Commands (Inferred from typical usage and configuration):

  While the chatgpt.lua file doesn't explicitly list all Neovim commands, ChatGPT plugins typically expose commands like:

   * `:ChatGPT`: This is the most common command to open a new chat session or interact with an existing one. It usually opens a dedicated chat buffer where you can type
     your prompts and see responses.
   * `:ChatGPTEditWithInstructions`: This command is explicitly mentioned in your configuration (edit_with_instructions). It likely takes your current selection or buffer
     content, allows you to provide instructions, and then presents a diff or modified version of your code based on ChatGPT's output.
   * `:ChatGPTActAs`: Some plugins allow you to set a "persona" for ChatGPT (e.g., "Act as a senior Python developer").
   * `:ChatGPTCode`: A command to send selected code for specific code-related tasks.
   * `:ChatGPTExplain`: To get an explanation of the selected code.
   * `:ChatGPTRefactor`: To refactor selected code.

  Keybindings (from your `chatgpt.lua`):

  The configuration defines numerous keymaps for interacting with the plugin, especially within its chat and edit modes:

   * Edit with Instructions Keymaps:
       * <C-c>: Close the edit window.
       * <C-y>: Accept the changes suggested by ChatGPT.
       * <C-d>: Toggle the diff view.
       * <C-o>: Toggle settings.
       * <Tab>: Cycle through windows.
       * <C-i>: Use the output as input for the next instruction.
   * Chat Keymaps:
       * <C-c>: Close the chat window.
       * <C-y>: Yank the last message.
       * <C-k>: Yank the last code block.
       * <C-u> / <C-d>: Scroll up/down.
       * <C-n>: Start a new chat session.
       * <Tab>: Cycle through windows.
       * <C-f>: Cycle through modes.
       * <C-j> / <C-k>: Navigate next/previous message.
       * <Space>: Select a session.
       * r: Rename a session.
       * d: Delete a session or message.
       * <C-r>: Draft a message or toggle message role.
       * e: Edit a message.
       * <C-o>: Toggle settings.
       * <C-p>: Toggle sessions window.
       * <C-h>: Toggle help.
       * <C-s>: Toggle system role open.
       * <C-x>: Stop generating.

  API Key Configuration:

   * The plugin expects your OpenAI API key to be set as an environment variable, likely OPENAI_API_KEY, as api_key_cmd is nil.

  Workflow Example:

   1. Start a chat: Type :ChatGPT and press Enter. A new window will open.
   2. Ask a question: Type your question or prompt in the input area and press <C-Enter> (or <Enter> for multi-line input).
   3. Get code explanation: Select a block of code in your buffer, then use a command like :ChatGPTExplain (if available) or initiate an "Edit with Instructions" flow.
   4. Refactor code: Select code, use :ChatGPTEditWithInstructions, provide instructions like "Refactor this function to be more concise," and then review and accept the
      changes.

  This plugin provides a powerful way to integrate AI directly into your coding workflow, making tasks like understanding, generating, and modifying code more efficient.
