That's a great idea for a complete reference! Including the ammunition selection keys (1, 2, 3) provides the full context of the Naval Action Bar (Keys 1 through 8+).

Here is the comprehensive list of the standard Naval Action Bar icons and their functions in War Thunder's Blue Water Battles:

| Default Key | Action                                 | Icon Description (What it looks like)                                                                                                          | Function in Naval Battles                                                                  |
