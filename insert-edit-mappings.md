Here are several mappings that work while insert mode. Perhaps some of these
might be new to you, or at least helpful for reinforcement:

ctrl-h – Delete previous character (same as backspace)
ctrl-w – Delete previous word
ctrl-u – Delete entire line (except any indent)
ctrl-t – Indent the current line
ctrl-d – Backdent the current line
