TIL: If I create a directory with mkdir -p "$HOME/folder/" I don't have to test if it exsists. If it doesn't it's created. If it's there the command is ignored.  JjVkeW3CA4UvMu  R*C^HAu7#U

In War Thunder, you can tell which way a tank's turret is pointing by looking at
the small arrow that appears above the tank's icon on the minimap. This arrow
points in the direction that the tank's turret is facing.

Additionally, when you are in the game, you can visually observe the orientation
of the tank's turret by looking at the tank model on your screen. The turret
will be facing the same direction as the gun barrel.

If you are playing in Simulator Battles mode, you can also use the sight on your
tank to look around and determine the orientation of other tanks' turrets.
