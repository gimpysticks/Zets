* **Social Reflection:** The halls provided a space where working-class identity was reflected and celebrated. Stars like Marie Lloyd and Vesta Tilley were often perceived as challenging the strict moral codes of the era, though their managers later worked to make the halls more respectable to attract a middle-class family audience.
