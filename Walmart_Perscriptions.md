That's a great question, and I can give you the steps to accomplish this!

Yes, you can absolutely **add your wife's prescriptions to your Walmart Pharmacy account for delivery**, and because you have a **Walmart+ membership**, that delivery will be **free** (with no order minimum).

Here is the general process:

### 1. Link Your Wife to Your Walmart Pharmacy Account

You need to connect your wife's prescription profile to your own Walmart.com account (the one with the Plus membership).

* **Log In** to your Walmart.com account (the Plus account).
* **Go to the Pharmacy Section:** Navigate to the Walmart Pharmacy homepage or section within your account settings (often labeled "My Account" or similar).
* **Find "Manage Family Members":** Look for an option like "**Manage family members**" or "**Manage family prescriptions**."
* **Add an Adult Family Member:** Follow the on-screen instructions to add an adult family member. You will likely need to provide her name, date of birth, and the email address associated with *her* existing regular Walmart account.
* **Wife Must Approve:** Because she is an adult, **she will receive an email or a notification** in her Walmart Pharmacy profile (the regular account) to **approve** your request to manage her prescriptions. She must accept this to grant you access.

### 2. Confirm Prescription Delivery is Enabled

Once the accounts are linked:

* **Check Her Prescriptions:** You should be able to view and manage her prescriptions from your Pharmacy dashboard.
* **Order Delivery:** When her prescription is ready, you will receive a notification. You can then add her ready-for-pickup prescription to your online cart, along with any other groceries or items you want delivered.
* **Walmart+ Benefit:** When you check out, the prescription delivery fee should be waived automatically because you are the Walmart+ member placing the order.

**Key Takeaway:** You do not need to merge the two *Walmart.com* accounts, and she doesn't need to purchase her own Plus membership. You just need to **link her prescription profile to your account** so you can order the prescription delivery under your existing Walmart+ benefits.
